            <p data-translate="organization">As part of a major transition, I successfully organized the relocation of the entire company to a new office space. This process required careful planning and coordination to ensure minimal disruption to daily operations. Early in the project, I worked closely with the owner of the company to design the infrastructure of the new network, taking into consideration both current and future technological needs. I researched and presented multiple options for the necessary equipment‚Äîsuch as switches, routers, patch panels, and workstations‚Äîcarefully evaluating each for reliability, cost-effectiveness, and compatibility with the company‚Äôs workflow.</p>
            <p data-translate="installation">Once the equipment was approved, we began the installation process by pulling network cables through to all designated workstations and office areas. After routing the cables and installing the necessary wall sockets, all connections were terminated at a central patch panel. From there, the network was connected to a 24-port switch, which was then linked to the company‚Äôs router, creating a stable and organized network backbone. This setup ensured efficient data flow and ease of management for future upgrades or maintenance.</p>
            <p data-translate="post_deployment">Following the completion of the core network infrastructure, we moved the company‚Äôs server into a dedicated server rack and proceeded to set up all newly acquired computers. This included configuring each machine, transferring all necessary data from employees‚Äô old systems, and ensuring seamless access to shared resources. The final steps involved installing and configuring office printers and photocopiers across the network. Post-deployment, I continued to provide technical support whenever needed, ensuring that the transition remained smooth and that all systems operated without issue.</p>
