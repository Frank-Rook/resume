    <p data-translate="greeting">Hello, my name is Veselko, and I am a passionate educator and advocate for hands-on learning experiences. I believe in the power of technology to inspire creativity and critical thinking in students. My goal is to create engaging and interactive learning environments that empower learners to explore and innovate.
In my free time, I like to work out, train martial arts, and explore new technologies.</p>
      <p data-translate="earlyAge">From an early age, I developed a wide range of interests that shaped both my personal and professional journey. As a young boy, I spent four years playing soccer for the HNK Ora≈°je club, where I played as a goalkeeper. Unfortunately, my eyesight began to deteriorate at a relatively early age, which prevented me from pursuing the sport at a more serious level. Despite this setback, I still enjoy playing soccer recreationally, and the sport remains one of my lifelong passions.      </p>
      <p data-translate="music">Alongside sports, I also pursued music. During elementary school, I attended six years of music school, where I studied piano and music theory in parallel with my regular education. Later, during high school, I discovered the guitar and taught myself to play, further expanding my appreciation for music and creativity.</p>
      <p data-translate="technology">Another strong interest of mine has always been technology and gaming. I was fascinated not only by playing games but also by exploring their hidden mechanics‚Äîfinding and exploiting glitches, experimenting with modifications, and testing boundaries. This curiosity naturally led me to experiment with HTML coding and tools like Cheat Engine, which allowed me to manipulate values in programs (for example, adjusting in-game gold in browser games). These early experiences planted the seeds of my future interest in information technology and software development.</p>
      <p data-translate="education">After high school, I attempted to enroll in a Philosophy and English Studies program, focusing on the subjects I enjoyed most. However, I underestimated the importance of mathematics in the entrance process and ultimately placed just below the acceptance threshold. As a result, I decided to pursue Mechanical Engineering instead. Although I completed two years in this field, my true interest remained in technology. During this time, I began experimenting with Unity, creating basic platformer games and teaching myself the fundamentals of game development. After five years of struggling with a program that didn‚Äôt align with my passions, I ultimately decided to leave Mechanical Engineering and pursue a career in Information Technology‚Äîthe one constant interest throughout my years of education.</p>
      <p data-translate="experience">Since making that decision, I have built up valuable professional experience in the IT field. I have gained hands-on knowledge in repairing a wide variety of hardware, including computers, laptops, printers, and even smartphones. I have also set up and configured security camera systems, networks, and servers for businesses, ensuring smooth integration with client devices.</p>
      <p data-translate="experiences">Beyond technical repair and infrastructure, I have worked in both sales and customer support, which helped me develop strong interpersonal skills and a professional approach to working with clients. Additionally, part of my experience includes software testing‚Äîidentifying bugs, glitches, and usability issues‚Äîas well as creating websites for several companies.</p>
      <p data-translate="journey">Altogether, my journey reflects both versatility and persistence: from sports and music to technology and IT, I‚Äôve continuously sought to learn, adapt, and apply my skills in meaningful ways.</p>
