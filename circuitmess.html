            <p>CircuitMess is a STEM for kids kind of company, producing various devices which first have to be soldered together and built. We used the <a href="https://circuitmess.com/products/byteboi">ByteBoi</a> as a learning tool for children to understand soldering in a safe environment, working on their critical thinking by assembly, with the reward of getting to play the pre-loaded games on the device! The children got to keep the devices they made, and as for the ones who unfortunately couldn't finish their devices, we finished it for them and sent them afterwards!</p>

            <p>The entire project lasted 2 weeks, and since the children learned how to solder pretty well, we had time left over to even program our own little Pacman-like videogame on these devices! The game was then coded in <a href="https://github.com/CircuitMess/CircuitBlocks">CircuitBlocks</a>, which is based on Google's Blockly and turns blocks into arduino-compatible code.</p>
