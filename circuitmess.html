            <p data-translate="stemForKids">CircuitMess is a STEM for kids kind of company, producing various devices which first have to be soldered together and built. We used the <a href="https://circuitmess.com/products/byteboi">ByteBoi</a> as a learning tool for children to understand soldering in a safe environment, working on their critical thinking by assembly, with the reward of getting to play the pre-loaded games on the device! The children got to keep the devices they made, and as for the ones who unfortunately couldn't finish their devices, we finished it for them and sent them afterwards!</p>
            <p data-translate="soldering">In the first week of the project, we focused on the hardware assembly. This involved soldering the buttons, screen, and batteries onto the PCB to get the devices fully set up and operational. By the end of the week, all the essential components were in place, and the devices were ready for testing.</p>
            <p data-translate="coding">In the second week, we shifted our focus to coding. We introduced the children to <a href="https://github.com/CircuitMess/CircuitBlocks">CircuitBlocks</a>, a visual programming language similar to Scratch, which is designed specifically for CircuitMess devices. The kids learned how to create simple programs and games using drag-and-drop blocks, allowing them to see immediate results on their ByteBoi devices. This hands-on experience helped them understand basic programming concepts in a fun and engaging way.</p>
